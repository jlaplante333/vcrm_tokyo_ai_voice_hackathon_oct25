# See https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm for more information about pnpm.

# By default, pnpm will not install dependencies for packages that are not in the workspace.
# This is useful for monorepos where you want to install dependencies only for the packages you're working on.
# If you want to install dependencies for all packages, you can use `pnpm install --recursive`.

# Enable strict peer dependencies
strict-peer-dependencies=false

# Auto install peer dependencies
auto-install-peers=true

# Enable hoisting
hoist-pattern[]=*

# Store packages in node_modules/.pnpm
